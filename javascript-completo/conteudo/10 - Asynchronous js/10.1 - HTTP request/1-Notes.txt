-----HTTP Request-----

What is?

Sometimes we want to show stuff on our website which is stored in some kind of database or in another server somewhere such as blog posts, 
or comments, or maybe a list of songs or even user data for a profile page. Now all of that data could be stored on another server somewhere 
or in your own database so we'd make what's known as an "http request" to reach out to that external server on that database to get that data 
and then do something with it.

In a nutshell, HTTP requests:

- Make HTTP requests to get data from another server
- We make these requests to API endpoints (These are URLs that a particular API server exposes to us so that we can use it to get data from them.)


(See the image "2 - APIs Endpoints")

Once we make a request to an endpoint from the browser we typically get back a selection of data in a format called json. Json is a format 
which looks very much like javascript objects and then we can do something with that data.
